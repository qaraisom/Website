      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <p>
        Hello all! As someone who has always enjoyed learning new things,
        especially languages, learning programming has become a passion of mine.
        I consider myself a creative and detail-oriented person, and I love
        being able to express my creativity through web development and design.
        In order to sharpen my skills, I enrolled in Thinkful's engineering
        immersion program, and the languages that I am currently learning
        include:
      </p>

      <ul class="wrapper-list">
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the very near future, I hope to learn</p>

      <ul class="wrapper-list">
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>Node</li>
        <li>Express</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Sass</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Outside of web development my hobbies include hiking, traveling to new
        places, practicing French or Spanish, going to cute coffee shops, and
        woodburning!
      </p>

      <p>
        I plan on graduating by November 2020, and will be looking and available
        for full-time development jobs at this time! I am very excited to work
        with a team of passionate developers, and to learn as much as I can from
        them! Currently, I am located in Denton, TX, but I am willing and able
        to move anywhere for the right opportunity.
      </p>
